Footnotes:
1,"Figures may not add to totals due to rounding."
2,"Estimates for 2018 may not be comparable to those for 2016 due to improved coverage and definitions as well as changes in survey methodology."
3,"Very poor: as of 2018, defined as having an immediate need to replace most or all of the asset. Health and safety hazards exist which present a possible risk to public safety or asset cannot be serviced/operated without risk to personnel. Major work or replacement required urgently.  The operating asset has less than 10% of its expected service life remaining. "
4,"Poor: as of 2018, defined as a failure likely and substantial work required in the short term. Asset barely serviceable. No immediate risk to health or safety. The operating asset has less than 40% of its expected service life remaining."
5,"Fair: as of 2018, defined as significant deterioration is evident; minor components or isolated sections of the asset need replacement or repair now but asset is still serviceable and functions safely at adequate level of service. The operating asset has at least 40% of its expected service life remaining."
6,"Good: as of 2018, defined as acceptable physical condition; minimal short-term failure risk but potential for deterioration in the long term. Only Minor work required. The operating asset has at least 80% of its expected service life remaining."
7,"Very good: as of 2018, defined as having a sound physical condition. Asset likely to perform adequately. The operating asset has at least 95% of its expected service life remaining."
8,"Reservoir: A pond, lake, or basin (natural or artificial) that stores, regulates, or controls water. Includes the number of reservoirs and water towers within the distribution, transmission, or integrated system."
9,"Pump stations include pump stations within the non-linear potable water system."
10,"Local water pipes include all connecting pipes, of diameter less than 416 mm, between pump stations, rechlorination facilities and storage facilities if these are located within the distribution system."
11,"Transmission pipes include all connecting pipes, of diameter greater than or equal to 416mm, between pump stations, rechlorination facilities and storage facilities when located between the source and the treatment plant or between the treatment plant and the distribution system."

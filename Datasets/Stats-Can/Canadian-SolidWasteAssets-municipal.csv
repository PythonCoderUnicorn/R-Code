Footnotes:
1,"Figures may not add to totals due to rounding."
2,"Estimates for 2018 may not be comparable to those for 2016 due to improved coverage and definitions as well as changes in survey methodology."
3,"Transfer station assets include facilities at which wastes transported by vehicles involved in collection are transferred to other vehicles that will transport the wastes to a disposal (landfill or incinerator) or recycling facility. Include transfer station assets owned by your organization or leased by your organization through a capital lease agreement."
4,"Composting: A managed, biological process through which organic matter is degraded under aerobic conditions to a relatively stable, humus-like material called compost."
5,"Material recovery facility: A facility in which recyclable materials are removed from waste, or mixed recyclable materials are sorted into distinct categories and prepared for shipment."
6,"Anaerobic digestion: A controlled and managed biological process that uses microorganisms to break down organic material in the absence of oxygen."
7,"Engineered landfill: A landfill designed to meet or exceed jurisdiction of authority requirements for the protection of the environment and human health. The design incorporates both the attributes of the natural environment and supplements them with the necessary engineered systems to achieve the required level of protection."
8,"Incineration: The burning of waste in an incinerator is essentially a rapid oxidation process that generates heat and converts the waste to the gaseous products of combustion, namely carbon dioxide and water vapour, which are released to the atmosphere."
9,"Energy from waste: Technologies that process waste using high temperatures to reduce the quantity of material requiring disposal, stabilize the material requiring disposal, and recover energy and potentially material resources."

"
2,"Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are estimated using global warming potentials for methane and nitrous oxide of 25 and 298 respectively."
3,"Emission sources included in these estimates: combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; non-combustion uses of fossil fuels; industrial processes; agricultural soils; livestock manure and enteric fermentation."
4,"The supply and use tables are built around three classification systems, namely the Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) for industries, the Supply and Use Product Classification (SUPC) for products (goods and services), and the Input-Output Final Demand Classification (IOFDC) for final demand categories. The Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) is based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and the Supply and Use Product Classification (SUPC) is based on the North American Products Classification System (NAPCS). The Input-Output Final Demand Classification is based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) for the personal expenditure categories and the North American Industry Classification (NAICS) for the gross fixed capital formation categories.  This table is published at the link 1961 level of the supply and use tables."
5,"The alphanumeric codes appearing in square brackets beside each industry title represent the Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) codes. The IOIC identifies both institutional sectors and industries based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The first two characters of the IOIC alphanumeric codes represent the sector. IOIC codes beginning with a BS represent business sector industries, codes beginning with an NP represent Non-Profit Institutions Serving Household (NPISH) sector industries, and codes beginning with a GS represent government sector industries."
6,"This table replaces table 38-10-0111-01."
7,"Totals may not add due to rounding."
8,"For more information on the concepts, sources and methods, please consult the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/16-509-x/2016001/29-eng.htm">Greenhouse gas emissions account</a> section of the Methodological guide: Canadian System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (<a href = "http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc.action?objId=16-509-X&objType=2&lang=en&limit=0">16-509-X</a>)."
9,"As of January 2019, in addition to national data, preliminary estimates for the greenhouse gas emissions account are available for each province and territory."
10,"Data for 2009 to 2017 were revised in March 2021.
"
11,"As of reference year 2014, the classifications of the supply and use tables have been modified to include cannabis related industries."
12,"Environment and Climate Change Canada is responsible for producing a separate set of greenhouse gas estimates:  <a href ="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/inventory.html"> Canada's official National Greenhouse Gas Inventory</a> and associated Report (National Inventory Report: Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada). Canada’s official greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory fulfills Canada's reporting obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and is the official benchmark for greenhouse gas emissions in Canada."
13,"The reporting requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) differ from the methodological guidelines of the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting used to create this account. As such there are differences between the totals reported in the Greenhouse Gas Account and Canada's National Inventory Report on Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks. These differences are included with the Greenhouse Gas Account and are described in IMDB 5115.

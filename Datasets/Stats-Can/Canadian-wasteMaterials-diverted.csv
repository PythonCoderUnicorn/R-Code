1,"This information covers only those companies and local waste management organizations that reported non-hazardous recyclable material preparation activities and refers only to that material entering the waste stream and does not cover any waste that may be managed on-site by a company or household. Additionally, these data do not include those materials transported by the generator directly to secondary processors, such as pulp and paper mills, while bypassing entirely any firm or local government involved in waste management activities."
2,"This table replaces and combines information published in tables 38-10-0033 and 38-10-0034, prior to 2018."
3,"Source: Statistics Canada, Environment and Energy Statistics Division."
4,"Revisions are made for the previous survey reference period, with the initial release of the current data, as required."
5,"Residential and non-residential splits are not available at the total level, as electronic and tire source data are unavailable."
6,"Residential non-hazardous recyclable materials include solid non-hazardous materials produced in all residences and include non-hazardous materials that are picked up by the municipality (either using its own staff or through contracting firms) and non-hazardous materials from residential sources that are self-hauled to depots, transfer stations and disposal facilities."
7,"Non-residential sources include solid non-hazardous recyclable material from the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional (IC and I) sector as well as the Construction, Renovation and Demolition sector (CRD). Materials are those generated by all IC and I and CRD sources in a municipality, and are excluded from the residential waste stream."
8,"Provincial tonnages of diverted Electronics for 2018 were taken from the Electronic Products Recycling Association (EPRA) report, (https://epra.ca/who-we-are/annual-report; accessed December 2020) and Alberta Recycling Management Authority (ARMA) report (https://www.albertarecycling.ca/about/reports/; accessed December 2020). Ontario and Territorial diversion amounts were generated using survey data."
9,"Diverted amounts of tires and electronics were obtained using alternative datasets: source information is not available."
10,"Prior to 2018, "Gable top and aseptic containers" were included with "Other Materials"."
11,"Prior to 2018, "Textiles" may have been included in "Other Materials", however respondents were not asked specifically to report this material."
12,"Provincial tonnages of diverted tires for 2018 were taken from the Canadian Association of Tire Recycling Agencies (CATRA) report, (https://www.catraonline.ca/publications; accessed December 2020).  Territorial diversion amounts were generated using survey data."
13,""Other Materials" includes non-hazardous materials that were reported as diverted but were not included in any of the specified categories.  Prior to 2018, this category included "Gable top and aseptic containers" and "Textiles"."
14,"Includes "Newsprint", "Cardboard and boxboard", and "Mixed paper"."
15,"Waste diversion data for Quebec are derived from a survey administered by RECYC-QUÉBEC. Note that the amount of white goods reported by RECYC-QUÉBEC is disproportionately larger than that reported by other provincial and territorial jurisdictions. The definition of white goods and the collection methodology used by RECYC-QUÉBEC for this category of material differs from that of Statistics Canada's Waste Management Industry Survey, resulting in this discrepancy. All white goods in Quebec were allocated to the non-residential source category."
